The PiE Alumni Scholarship returns for our 8th year in recognizing the many high-achieving high school seniors graduating from our program! Our finalists this year were again a strong pool of candidates chosen for not only their achievements throughout high school, but also their goals and dreams for the future, which reflect PiE’s mission of giving back to the community and furthering the reach of STEM and education. Here are our 2021 PiE Alumni Scholarship Finalists.

#### Charmienne Butterfield
Charmienne is a member of Berkeley Technology Academy’s PiE team. She has been an active member of organizations such as Black Girls Code, Built by Girls, and Inneract Project. Building on her passion for computer science, storytelling, and the arts, she is planning to pursue Design at UC Berkeley this fall. Charmienne hopes to be a role model and inspiration for future students interested in STEM. 

#### Thomas Leung 
Thomas is a veteran PiE participant from Middle College. Outside of PiE, Thomas pursued his passion for rockets by building a 3D printed rocket entirely from scratch with his classmates — to be launched soon. He also loves to help out his fellow classmates, and was asked to be a teacher’s assistant for a college level statistics course. Unable to choose between his fiery passion for both rocket science and math, Thomas plans to pursue a double major at UCLA in aerospace engineering and mathematics. 

#### Zi Yan Wu
Zi Yan hails from Skyline in Oakland, CA. His love for computer science brought him into PiE where he has spent the past three years as the programming lead, and is the current president of Skyline’s robotics team. Zi Yan will continue exploring Computer Science at MIT next year. He hopes that he can be an inspiration and mentor for those in his community who are interested in pursuing STEM and higher education.

#### Laila Walker
Laila is the captain of El Cerrito’s PiE team. She has invested her time back into her community through the Black Student Union, Amnesty International, Sunpower Corp, and the Watershed Project. Well equipped to take on the world, Laila will pursue Civil Engineering at UC Berkeley this coming fall, with a focus towards dismantling socioeconomic disparities in cityscapes and infrastructure. 

#### Naydelin Cabrera
Our winner is a student from Pinole Valley High School. Naydelin’s interests and experiences in high school have been diverse, from taking on a variety of roles with her PiE team to participating in Earth Team’s Sustainable Youth Internship program. Naydelin plans to attend Contra Costa Community College next year to set a strong foot forward towards achieving her goal of becoming a physician’s assistant, where she will use her training to directly help people in need. Aside from giving back to the community through her profession, Naydelin plans to pay-it-forward by being a mentor and active resource for other first-generation students who are interested in pursuing higher education and professions in STEM. Congratulations to Naydelin Cabrera as this year’s PiE Alumni Scholarship winner.
